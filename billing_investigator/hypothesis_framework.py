# Analysis Workflow Template (7.2 & 7.3)
ANALYSIS_WORKFLOW = """
## Hypothesis Generation Workflow

When analyzing a usage increase, follow this systematic approach:

### Step 1: Gather Baseline Data
- Query historical period data (typically 1-3 months prior)
- Query current period data showing the increase
- Use `get_customer_usage_data()` for detailed hourly data
- Use `query_usage_patterns()` for aggregated insights

### Step 2: Calculate Key Metrics
- Use `calculate_period_comparison()` to get overall change statistics
- Identify which appliances show the largest increases
- Note: Changes >20% are typically significant, >50% are major

### Step 3: Analyze Each Significant Change
For each appliance showing >20% increase:

**For HVAC (heating/cooling):**
- Use `correlate_with_weather()` to check temperature relationship
- Compare degree-hours change to HVAC usage change
- If HVAC increased >30% but degree-hours only +10% â†’ likely thermostat or efficiency issue

**For EV Charging:**
- Check if load pattern is new (zero in baseline)
- Verify night-time charging pattern (10pm-6am, 3-7 kW)
- Calculate kWh/day to estimate miles driven

**For Pool Equipment:**
- Verify seasonal appropriateness (summer only)
- Check if runtime extended (compare hours of operation)
- 6-8 hours daily is normal, >10 hours suggests issue

**For Other Loads:**
- Look for new sustained patterns
- Check time-of-day shifts with `analyze_time_patterns()`
- Identify gradual vs sudden changes

### Step 4: Generate Hypotheses
For each finding, create a hypothesis with:
- **Category**: Select from HVAC_INCREASE, NEW_LOAD, TIME_SHIFT, etc.
- **Confidence**: Based on data quality and correlation strength
  - High (0.7-1.0): Strong evidence, clear pattern, good correlation
  - Medium (0.4-0.7): Moderate evidence, some ambiguity
  - Low (0.0-0.4): Weak evidence, multiple possible causes
- **Evidence**: Specific data points supporting the hypothesis
- **Recommendations**: Actionable steps to verify or address

### Step 5: Rank and Present
- Rank hypotheses by confidence score and impact
- Present top 2-3 most likely causes
- Include estimated savings potential for each

# Few-Shot Examples (7.4)

## Example Scenarios

### Example 1: HVAC Thermostat Change

**Input Data:**
- July usage: 1,450 kWh (vs June: 1,050 kWh, +38%)
- HVAC cooling: 680 kWh (vs June: 450 kWh, +51%)
- Cooling degree-hours: 1,650 (vs June: 1,500, +10%)
- Weather correlation: r=0.65

**Analysis:**
HVAC cooling increased 51% while degree-hours only increased 10%. This disproportionate increase suggests the HVAC system is running more than weather alone would explain. Temperature correlation is moderate (r=0.65) but the magnitude mismatch is the key indicator.

**Hypothesis Generated:**
{
  "category": "hvac_increase",
  "description": "HVAC cooling usage increased 51% despite only 10% increase in cooling degree-hours, suggesting thermostat setting may have been lowered",
  "confidence_score": 0.85,
  "evidence": [
    "HVAC cooling: 680 kWh vs 450 kWh baseline (+230 kWh, +51%)",
    "Cooling degree-hours only increased 10% (1,650 vs 1,500)",
    "Expected increase based on weather: ~45 kWh, actual: 230 kWh"
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Check thermostat setting - recommend 78Â°F for cooling efficiency",
    "Inspect air filter and replace if dirty",
    "Consider programmable thermostat to maintain consistent temperature"
  ],
  "potential_savings": 45.00
}

**Conversational Output:**
"Your AC usage jumped significantly in Julyâ€”up 51% from June. Here's the interesting part: it only got about 10% hotter outside, but your AC is using way more energy than the weather change would explain. This usually means the thermostat got set a few degrees lower. Bumping it back up to 78Â°F could save you around $45/month while keeping your home comfortable."

### Example 2: New EV Charger Detection

**Input Data:**
- August usage: 1,285 kWh (vs July: 1,050 kWh, +22%)
- EV charging: 0 kWh â†’ 135 kWh (new load)
- Charging pattern: 10pm-2am, 4-6 kW, 5 days/week
- Started: August 10

**Analysis:**
A new sustained load of ~135 kWh/month appeared starting August 10, with a characteristic night-time charging pattern (10pm-2am) at Level 2 charger power levels (4-6 kW). This pattern is consistent with residential EV charging, typically 5 days per week.

**Hypothesis Generated:**
{
  "category": "new_load",
  "description": "New EV charging pattern detected starting August 10, adding ~135 kWh/month",
  "confidence_score": 0.95,
  "evidence": [
    "EV charging increased from 0 to 135 kWh",
    "Consistent night-time pattern: 10pm-2am, 4-6 kW",
    "Charging 5 days/week pattern",
    "Started abruptly on August 10"
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Confirm new EV purchase or charging routine",
    "Consider shifting to midnight-6am if utility offers off-peak rates",
    "Monitor charging frequency if usage seems high"
  ],
  "potential_savings": null
}

**Conversational Output:**
"I spotted something new in your August dataâ€”it looks like you started charging an electric vehicle around August 10th. The charging pattern is typical for a home EV: overnight sessions (10pm-2am) about 5 times a week, adding roughly 135 kWh per month. If your utility offers time-of-use rates, charging between midnight and 6am could save you money."

---

### Example 3: Work-From-Home Time Shift

**Input Data:**
- September usage: 1,120 kWh (vs August: 1,050 kWh, +7%)
- Peak hour shifted: 7pm â†’ 2pm
- Weekday 9am-5pm usage: +25%
- Total usage only slightly up

**Analysis:**
Total usage increased modestly (+7%), but the timing changed dramatically. The peak usage hour shifted from evening (7pm) to afternoon (2pm), and weekday daytime usage (9am-5pm) increased 25%. This pattern is consistent with someone working from home rather than being away during the day.

**Hypothesis Generated:**
{
  "category": "time_shift",
  "description": "Usage pattern shifted to daytime hours, consistent with work-from-home transition",
  "confidence_score": 0.75,
  "evidence": [
    "Peak hour shifted from 7pm to 2pm",
    "Weekday 9am-5pm usage increased 25%",
    "Total usage only up 7% (pattern change, not new load)",
    "Weekend pattern unchanged"
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Consider adjusting thermostat during unoccupied hours if schedule changes",
    "Use natural lighting during daytime to reduce lighting needs",
    "Be mindful of phantom loads from always-on equipment"
  ],
  "potential_savings": 15.00
}

**Conversational Output:**
"Your September bill shows an interesting change in when you're using energy, not just how much. Your peak usage moved from evening to mid-afternoon, and weekday daytime usage is up 25%. This pattern typically happens when someone starts working from home. The good news: your total usage only went up 7%, so you're being pretty efficient! Adjusting your thermostat for your new schedule could save another $15/month."
